This project visualizes and maps Catholic school enrollment changes over time (as indicated by NCES Private School Universe Survey data) at the state, county, and diocesan level.

## Data accuracy notes and disclaimer

A comparison of the enrollment totals produced within this project to National Catholic Education Association (NCEA) statistics from 2017-2018 to 2021-2022 ([available here](https://nceatalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data_Brief_22_Catholic_School_Enrollment_v4.pdf)) and for 2012-2013 ([available here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240623163426/https://www.ncea.org/NCEA/NCEA/Who_We_Are/About_Catholic_Schools/Catholic_School_Data/Enrollment_and_Staffing.aspx)) indicates that the yearly enrollment totals calculated within this project are often <span style="color:red">**lower than the actual values**</span>. This is most likely because a significant proportion of Parent School Surveys are not answered by schools. <span style="color:red">**In addition, the drop in response rates from 2011-2012 to 2019-2020 may have exaggerated the enrollment declines observed by this script.**</span> (See response rates for recent school years below.)

My hope is that, despite the flaws in this data caused by low response rates, these analyses can still indicate which counties, dioceses, and states have higher or lower Catholic school enrollment growth relative to their peers. (However, it's possible that these relative rankings are *also* skewed by changes in response rates from year to year.)

In addition, some incorrect/outdated county codes were encountered within the original datasets; code was added in to correct these issues, but some inaccuracies may remain. This is another reason to interpret county-level data within this script with caution. 

Base-weighted total frame response rates by year: (These rates encompass all schools in the PSS, not just Catholic schools. Catholic school response rates may differ significantly from these averages.)
