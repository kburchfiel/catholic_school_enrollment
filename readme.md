This project, still a work in progress, visualizes and maps Catholic school enrollment changes over time (as indicated by NCES Private School Universe Survey data) at the state, county, and diocesan level.

## Data accuracy notes:
Certain apparent increases or decreases in enrollment may be partially or entirely due to changes in Private School Universe Survey response rates. In addition, some incorrect/outdated county codes were encountered within the original datasets; code was added in to correct these issues, but some inaccuracies may remain. For these reasons, the output of this script should be interpreted with caution.
